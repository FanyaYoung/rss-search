Post Haste

"Post Haste" is an application which will allow the user to set-up immediate, real-time search notifications for user-defined 
search terms, defined phrases, and alerts sent to the users email.

One example of the use of "Post Haste" would be for an individual to create an alert for a partiular job search.  If 
the user wantedf IMMEDIATE NOTIFIATION of a particular job, then "Post Haste" would allow the user to receive immediate notification
of the search term on the user-deefined website.  The user would define the parameters of his search (e.g. the website to be searched, like Craigslist, 
eBay, etc.), along with the object of his search (i.e. jobs for teachers, pistachio ice cream, dog parks in San Francisco, etc.).  Poste Haste takes
the information given, searches the website, and notifies the user of the results.  

No longer will a user lose a competitive edge for a job due to a "slow response."  Now, a user will receive word of a particular position 
AS SOON AS THE JOB POSTING IS EDITED.  

Feel free to send comments and suggestions.  Cheers!
